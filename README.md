Calculations of Quantum Oscillations with a Tight-Binding phenomenological model



TO DO : 

Add verbosity parameter so that one of the parallel process indicate progress of the calculation

Benchmark (Zhang, Maharaj, Kivelson 2015) and probably (Maharaj 2016) also (without CDW)
Benchmark then with YRZ probably with Zhang and Mei paper, and I gues I can also benchmark for CDW with the same paper
